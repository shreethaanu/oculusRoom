# oculusRoom 

The first oculus and app i call it “ STR’S Room ” 
This is a simple room with intractable components and an intro experience. 
Here I learnt about creating a place, how to set lightings (Its the Most important) that make people believe they exist there, adding relatable sounds, making objects intractable and more.
.
You can wander around place and use things there to make you feel more alive.
